Here's a list of SRE type books that I've been enjoying

## The Site Reliability Workbook

This book is a great staring place for any SRE.

## Site Reliability Engineering

[URL](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/)

Similar to the workbook, but more high level

## Kafka: The Definitive Guide

[URL](https://www.confluent.io/resources/kafka-the-definitive-guide/)

This is a free book, slightly dated book, but it's great if you want to get into Kafka

## Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track

[URL](https://staffeng.com/book)

Great book with stories of Staff level engineers, and details about technical leadership.

## Production Kubernetes

[URL](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/production-kubernetes) - Free if you have over your email address

This is a great book about running Production Kubernetes environments. The book balances going broad and deep at the same time. 

## Implementing Service Level Objectives

This book is a deep dive into SLOs. Very technical and very deep. If you want an overview of SLO, rather stick to Google's SRE books.

## Accelerate

A data-driven look at the software delivery pipeline, what drives it and what works well.

## The DevOps Handbook

Literally what it says on the tin, a handbook to DevOps.

## Observability Engineering
